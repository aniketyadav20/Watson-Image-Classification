<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Image classification can be referred to as the task of assigning a label to an image. Much of the field of histopathology is comprised of various classification tasks. This is since histopathology is mainly focused on assigning a diagnosis based on a review of slide-based microscopy. Automatic classification of tissue structures and subtypes can also be extremely useful to augment and improve the histopathology workflow.

### Built With

The Prototype is made using as follows:

* Python
* image classification
* Tensorflow Modules


-Tensorflow generally consists of many models such asâ†·
* ResNet 50
* MobileNet V2
* YOLO V3 And many more: during our project, we used ResNet 50 and MobileNet V2 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Any python Compiler (except google colab)

### Installation

1. Install packages
   ```sh
   from tkinter import *
   from PIL import ImageTk, Image  
   from tkinter import filedialog
   from imageai.Classification import ImageClassification 
   import image_classifier as imc
   ```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
* Drones: Drones equipped with image recognition capabilities can provide vision-based automatic monitoring, inspection, and control of the assets located in remote areas.
* Manufacturing: Inspecting production lines, evaluating critical points on a regular basis within the premises. Monitoring the quality of the final products to reduce the defects. Assessing the condition of the workers can help manufacturing industries to have a complete control of different activities in the systems.

* Autonomous Vehicles: Autonomous vehicles with image recognition can identify activities on the road and take necessary actions. Mini robots can help logistics industries to locate and transfer the objects from one place to another. It also maintains the database of the product movement history to prevent the product from being misplaced or stolen.
* Military Surveillance: Detection of unusual activities in the border areas and automatic decision-making capabilities can help prevent infiltration and result in saving the lives of soldiers.
* Forest Activities: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles can monitor the forest, predict changes that can result in forest fires, and prevent poaching. It can also provide a complete monitoring of the vast lands, which humans cannot access easily.
